<h1>Introduction to Web scrapping in R</h1>
<p>Web scrapping/crawling takes the advantages of common html tags to extract information from a webpage. It is useful in collecting and organising structured information for human or passed to further workflow.</p>
<p>In R platform, <code>rvest</code> is the package that includes functions to read html source code by providing page urls; with the help from a css selector as a chrome plugin <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/">SelectorGadget</a>, which identifies tags of interest, web scrapping can be realised without html/css knowledge.</p>
<p>The main source I learnt this technique are as follows.</p>

<div id="understand-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Understand the data</h1>
<p>The scrapping subject is from question pools of GRE Analytical Writing. There are two pools, <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/issue/pool">issue</a> and <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool">arguement</a>, with the format varies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue Pool is a list of 152. It starts with a prompt for contextualising to a specific topic and a task for providing a direction. Task portion contains 6 potential options and it always starts with “write a response in which you discuss…”. Prompt portion varies in format and number of sentences; two-sentence prompt are claim-response type, which the two start with “claim” and “response” respectively.</li>
<li>Argument Pool contains 176 entities. It also gives a background followed by task. The background varies while there are only 8 tasks which start with same “write a response in which you discuss…”. There are also two-sentence prompt and the first sentence is always “the following…”.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="approach" class="section level1">
<h1>Approach</h1>
<p>The strategy of scrapping this information from the web page and split them into prompt Vs task is as follows</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>from html web address, extract the individual entities by using html tags <code>.divider-50~ p , .indented p</code> (assisted by SelectorGadget).</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;readr&quot;, &quot;rvest&quot;, &quot;openxlsx&quot;, &quot;kableExtra&quot;)
x &lt;- sapply(x, require, character.only = TRUE)

scraping &lt;- function(url, css){
  html_text(html_nodes(read_html(url), css))
}

url_argument &lt;- &quot;https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool&quot;

## store issue and argument page as &quot;issue&quot; and &quot;argument&quot;, respectively
issue &lt;- scraping(url_issue, &quot;.divider-50~ p , .indented p&quot;) 
argument &lt;- scraping(url_argument, &quot;.divider-50~ p , .indented p&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To organised the scrapped information into prompt and question, I processed the captured information in</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>## For issue, find the index with sentense start with &quot;claim&quot;
start_claim &lt;- unname(which(sapply(issue, substr, start = 1, stop = 5 ) == &quot;Claim&quot;))

issue[start_claim] &lt;- paste(issue[start_claim], &quot;\n&quot;,issue[start_claim+1]) 
## delete item start with &quot;Reason&quot;

Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a “Palean” basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.

The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal.
“A recent study of eighteen rhesus monkeys provides clues as to the effects of birth order on an individual’s levels of stimulation. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol, which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring.”

The council of Maple County, concerned about the county’s becoming overdeveloped, is debating a proposed measure that would prevent the development of existing farmland in the county. But the council is also concerned that such a restriction, by limiting the supply of new housing, could lead to significant increases in the price of housing in the county. Proponents of the measure note that Chestnut County established a similar measure ten years ago, and its housing prices have increased only modestly since. However, opponents of the measure note that Pine County adopted restrictions on the development of new residential housing fifteen years ago, and its housing prices have since more than doubled. The council currently predicts that the proposed measure, if passed, will result in a significant increase in housing prices in Maple County.

There is now evidence that the relaxed pace of life in small towns promotes better health and greater longevity than does the hectic pace of life in big cities. Businesses in the small town of Leeville report fewer days of sick leave taken by individual workers than do businesses in the nearby large city of Masonton. Furthermore, Leeville has only one physician for its one thousand residents, but in Masonton the proportion of physicians to residents is five times as high. Finally, the average age of Leeville residents is significantly higher than that of Masonton residents. These findings suggest that people seeking longer and healthier lives should consider moving to small communities.

The following was written as a part of an application for a small-business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe.
“Jazz music is extremely popular in the city of Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe’s annual jazz festival last summer, and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is ‘Jazz Nightly,’ which airs every weeknight. Also, a number of well-known jazz musicians own homes in Monroe. Nevertheless, the nearest jazz club is over an hour away. Given the popularity of jazz in Monroe and a recent nationwide study indicating that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment, we predict that our new jazz music club in Monroe will be a tremendously profitable enterprise.”

<h1><a href="/GRE_AW.xlsx">Output</a> and reflection</h1>
<p>Capturing a data set was trivial while organising it requires a fair understand about its structure. The idea of organising GRE analytical issue and argument were conceived in a chronological order, so that the way to organise argument was more generalisable because it use a shared feature in the question instead of the feature only appear in each type. Although no bench marking on code efficiency was performed thus there was no guarantee on the efficiency of the code, this post persented a real life example which required a workflow involving web scrapping and data tidyup.</p>
